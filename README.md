Visual/physical notifications for Instagram powered by Intel Edison #IoT

Please read the Instructable I have created that explains how I built this project: http://bit.ly/1LYTIEZ

box-design - contains the .ai file for all the parts to be laser cut
one-hundred-thousand.py - Is the main file to run, you will need to alter a few variables to match your Instragram account, see comments in file.
examples-and-tests - Misc. tests and prototypes I made to experiment with the Instragram API and Grove start kit for the Intel Edison.
